**Pair Coding Notes**

**General Arrangement**
- Deliver Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow via GitHub by 4/21/2024
- General Steps: 1) Find the right tool/structure/codebase for RAG, 2) enable accurate location of dataset based on user's question, 3) enable accurate data processing based on user's need
- Suggested arrangement of pair coding
-- First 10 minutes: 1) outline tasks, 2) communicate division of labor
-- Last 10 minutes: 1) communicate next steps, 2) communicate take-home tasks, 3) Update the "Pair Programming Log.md"
