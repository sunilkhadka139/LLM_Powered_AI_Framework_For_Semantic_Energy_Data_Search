**Pair Coding Notes**

**General Arrangement**
- Deliver Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow via GitHub by 4/21/2024
- General Steps: 1) Find the right tool/structure/codebase for RAG, 2) enable accurate location of dataset based on user's question, 3) enable accurate data processing based on user's need
- Suggested arrangement of pair coding
-- First 10 minutes: 1) outline tasks, 2) communicate division of labor
-- Last 10 minutes: 1) communicate next steps, 2) communicate take-home tasks, 3) Update the "Pair Programming Log.md"

**Resources**
- RAG tutorial: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/large-language-models-semantic-search/
- TBD

**1. March 20, 2024**

Outlined Tasks
- Liang introduces and shares his RAG work
- Setup the environment
- Start watching video

Progress

-Re-build the code on local environment (anaconda)
-Re-build the code on collab so that we can make it accessible for other team members

Take-home tasks and Next Steps
- Watch the video, understand the logic behind the code
- Do research and try to think of the way to make boxdrive link accesible with the code.
- Do research on how people deal with different sturcture of the data source to their knowledge base.
- Try to find relevant algorithm for llm to chose between building data and transportation data at the beginning so that llm can know whether user is asking questions related to building or transportation.
