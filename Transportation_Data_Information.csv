Miovision_Intersection|[PCDOT_Miovision].[dbo].[mio_intersection_list]|Miovision_Crosswalk|The Miovision_Intersection dataset provides basic about individual intersections, offering identification numbers, user-assigned names, and geographic coordinates for location tracking. Additionally, the dataset allows for flexible data management through custom identifiers. More Info: [https://docs.api.miovision.com/]|API|Directory:(/Transportation_Data/Transportation_Miovision_Intersection.csv)|https://catsapi.ua-smart.org/miovision/intersections|
Miovision_Crosswalk|[PCDOT_Miovision].[dbo].[mio_crosswalk]|Miovision_Intersection, Traffic_terms|Miovision crosswalk data offers a concise summary of pedestrian and bicycle activities at intersections. Each entry is uniquely identified with a timestamp, recording the date and time of observations. The data categorizes movements into "Pedestrian" or "Bicycle," specifying the crosswalk side, direction (CW or CCW), and the quantity of observed activities.

Inrix_Segments|[ADOT_INRIX].[dbo].[InrixSegments]|Inrix_Speed|INRIX Segments database consists of two main segment types: XD segments and TMC segments. XD segments are INRIX's proprietary road segmentation system designed to break at significant intersections, with a maximum length of 1,600 meters, providing extensive coverage across all road classes. TMC segments encode Traffic Message Channel location tables onto the linear road network, primarily covering major roads. INRIX Segments data includes unique identifiers, segment type, free flow speed, length, road classification, name, country, latitude, and longitude. This data undergoes frequent updates to reflect changes in the road network. INRIX offers various methods to spatially describe XD segments for compatibility with diverse mapping systems.|API|Directory:(/Transportation_Data/Transportation_Inrix_Segments.csv)|https://catsapi.ua-smart.org/inrix/segments|
Inrix_Speed|[ADOT_INRIX].[dbo].[Inrix_Realtime]|Inrix_Segments, Traffic_terms|The Inrix Segment Speed dataset provides real-time and average speed information for road segments, enabling traffic condition and congestion level assessment. Each entry includes a timestamp, SegmentID, type (TMC or XDS), estimated speed, average speed, reference free-flow speed, confidence values, travel time, congestion levels, and segment closure information. The Segment Speeds API allows retrieving detailed road segment data based on geographies or specific identifiers, offering a valuable resource for real-time traffic monitoring, transportation planning, and informed decision-making.|API|Directory:(/Transportation_Data/Transportation_Inrix_Speed.csv)|https://catsapi.ua-smart.org/inrix/speeds?segment_id=115+04103&int_id=115+04443&date=2019-05-11|(1) Segment ID and Date are required  (2) Segment ID can be gotten from the result of the Inrix_Segments API (3) The amount of the Segment ID has to be less than 5 (4) date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
Traffic_terms||Miovision_Crosswalk,Inrix_Speed|The Traffic terms dataset lists the meaning of the special signs used in the related data sets. By referring to the information, people can have more understanding about the results.|Directory:(/Transportation_Data/Transportation_Traffic_terms.csv)|||
