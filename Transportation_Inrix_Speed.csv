Data Set|Column|Full Name|Data Type|Description
Inrix_Realtime|timestamp|Date and Time|Datetime |This datetime column captures the date and time information in the Phoniex time zone, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. This timestamp serves as a temporal reference for the real-time data associated with road segments, facilitating temporal analysis and synchronization with other datasets.
Inrix_Realtime|SegmentID|Inrix Segment id|String|A unique identifier for road segments that can take the form of either the Traffic Message Channel (TMC) code or the INRIX XD Segment ID. It plays a crucial role in linking real-time data with corresponding segments, ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis.
Inrix_Realtime|type|Inrix Segment type|String|A value indicating segment type, with "TMC" or "XDS" values. "XDS" signifies the use of INRIX XD technology, distinguishing between traditional TMC and advanced INRIX XD segments. TMC signified length from traffic message channel data.
Inrix_Realtime|speed|Speed on the segment|Integer|A value representing the estimated speed of the road segment for the given date and time. The speed is measured in miles per hour (MPH) and reflects the current speed conditions on the segment.
Inrix_Realtime|average|Average speed|Integer|A value that denotes the typical speed on the road segment for the specified date and time. The unit is miles per hour (MPH), providing a benchmark for assessing current speed conditions against the average.
Inrix_Realtime|reference|Free flow speed|Integer|A value representing the free flow speed on the road segment for the specified date and time. This free flow speed serves as a baseline for evaluating congestion and traffic conditions.
Inrix_Realtime|confidenceValue|Confidence Value|Integer|A value that indicates the probability of the value being accurate. This value can be used to analyze confidence levels for numerous models.
Inrix_Realtime|travelTimeMinutes|Travel time|Integer|A value  indicating the travel time along the road segment at the current speed, measured in minutes. This metric is valuable for assessing real-time travel conditions and potential delays.
Inrix_Realtime|speedBucket|Level of congestion|Integer(Category)|A vaue that refers to a predefined range of speeds or percentages utilized to categorize segment data. Each speed bucket is uniquely identified by a numerical label known as a speedbucketID. By default, the INRIX default speed bucket ID is employed for categorization. However, users have the flexibility to define custom speed buckets through the CreateSpeedBucket API, allowing for tailored speed classifications based on specific criteria or preferences. 
Inrix_Realtime|segment_closed|Segment is closed or not|Boolean|Indicates whether the segment is closed or not. If full resolution requested, no real-time speed will be returned, if sub-segment resolution is requested, real-time speeds will only be returned for sub-segments that are not closed.
