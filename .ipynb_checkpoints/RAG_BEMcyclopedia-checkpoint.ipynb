[1] It can be as simple as a series of sketches, or it can be more a more detailed set of 3D models and other materials to help communicate the design vision to the client. It is typically an iterative process where the architect works with the client and other team members to refine the concepts and prepare for the latter phases of the project. [1]\\nSometimes architects will develop the conceptual designs during the proposal phase (before being selected by the owner) as a way to demonstrate their design philosophy and processes. Since this work may begin before a contract is awarded, the BEM activities in this section are often performed by the architects or, an engineering or BEM consultant on the bidding team may assist the architect \"at risk\" to help win the project.

These design kickoff steps help orient the designers to a project’s unique performance opportunities:', 'Establish or confirm project goals/targets\\nAt the start of conceptual design, confirm the performance goals established in pre-design. Or, if performance goals were not set during pre-design, do it now! Assess likely energy use patterns\\nIdentify likely patterns such as end-use energy breakdown and seasonal consumption. This information provided early in the design process can help the design team to focus efforts on high priority efficiency strategies. There are several approaches to identifying energy use patterns before a concept design has been developed. Develop a simple box model, then analyze the outputs to find insights about its efficiency opportunities. Run a prototype model\\nFind performance data for similar buildings in reference sources such as ASHRAE\\'s Advanced Energy Design Guides\\nFind benchmark data for your building type\\nDesign charrettes\\nDesign charrettes are interactive brainstorming sessions held early in the design or programming stages of a project. \"[They] place the client and other stakeholders, as well as all or most of the professional disciplines that will contribute to the project, in the same room for, usually, one to three days.\" [2]\\nGoals of the charrette include \"kicking-off the integrated design process, reviewing project expectations, and exploring design strategies that are most appropriate to achieve a project’s sustainable design goals. \"[3]\\nAn \"energy charrette\" held early during design is one of the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 209. Some of the required topics include determining the purpose of the BEM in the project, defining baselines, establishing perfromance metrics, reviewing benchmarks and generating a list of ECMs. BEM Practitioners can assist the charrette process by helping to:', \"Brainstorm and vet ECMs\\nPerform pre-charrette analysis\\nPerform analysis during the charrette\\nPerform post-charrette analysis\\nRead more about Using BEM to support a charrette. Building Form and Mass\\nMassing refers to the three-dimensional shape of the building,[4] and may also be called the building's form. [5] Decisions about the form and mass of a building can have meaningful energy impacts that are permanent (you can't easily retrofit the building's footprint), so BEM analysis in this phase is extremely important though it is often overlooked. BEM practitioners can assist with the following tasks:  \", \"Compare massing options - If multiple massing alternatives are being considered, a model can assess their relative performance in terms of EUI, energy cost,  peak cooling load, or other metrics important to the project. Analyze the building's orientation - determine how the building's orientation on the site (with respect to sun exposure and prevailing wind conditions) may impact its performance. Design Features\\nDuring this phase, many design features will be evaluated for inclusion in the project. These may be structural features, features of the facade, concepts related to passive design features such as natural ventilation or daylighting, and types of active systems (e.g. HVAC, lighting) that are desirable for the project. The BEM practitioner can be instrumental in evaluating different options and demonstrating their relative performance so that the design team can make informed selections. Some options, such as HVAC system type or natural ventilation, may have some bearing on the building's form due to floor-to-floor height requirements or depth of footprint. Additionally, an assessment of thermal comfort associated with design choices can begin at this stage. For projects that are considering multiple options of form and mass (as discussed above), some design features may perform well on one massing option but not as well on another, so it is important that design features are analyzed within that context. BEM can be used to analyze design features in many categories:\", 'Constructions and thermal mass options\\nFenestration and daylighting options\\nHVAC system options\\nNatural ventilation design features\\nPassive solar design features\\nRenewable energy options\\nAssess Design Performance\\nAfter the project team has developed a design concept, then BEM can be used to assess its performance. This assessment can be useful at any point during the conceptual design process. For example, it can serve as a first step before evaluating alternatives, when it can help to establish a performance baseline and highlight opportunities to explore. It can also be used to track performance compared to project goals at any point along the way. There are some important points to keep in mind when using BEM to assess performance during early design. There is significant unavoidable uncertainty; many inputs will be based on educated guesses about later design decisions and building operation. Any reporting of energy use predictions should note the uncertainty. Running multiple versions of the model with a range of inputs for uncertain variables (e.g. plug loads, schedules of building operation) can be useful to show how predicted energy use will vary depending on assumptions made at this stage. If an energy consumption prediction is desired, then extra attention from the owner and design team is needed to review model inputs and ensure that assumptions represent likely building operation. BEM will be most useful at this stage for comparing the relative performance of design concepts. Compare performance to targets\\nBEM analysis is vital to ensuring that the design is on track to meet the project’s performance goals. Knowing the current design’s performance helps to inform further design decisions. While there will be uncertainty at this early stage, the BEM results are still useful as a preliminary check on design performance. The results will be especially useful for comparing how different concepts contribute to meeting targets. Identify priorities for improvement\\nEvery project is different and may have unique opportunities for improvement. Those opportunities will vary depending on factors like climate, site, building occupancy and owner preferences. BEM can be used to identify which elements of a design concept are most critical to performance and inform further conceptual design decisions. Read more about using BEM analysis to provide insights. Assess heating and cooling loads\\nMany of the decisions made during the conceptual design phase affect the heating and cooling loads that need to be met by the HVAC system. These include decisions like building form, orientation, window area, and construction types. BEM can provide a preliminary estimate of the peak heating and cooling loads for a design concept. These loads are important because they affect the size and cost of the HVAC system. Assess resilience\\nUse BEM to assess a design in terms of maintaining comfort conditions when active HVAC systems are not available. BEM is most commonly used to estimate energy consumed by HVAC systems to maintain indoor comfort conditions. However, BEM can also be used to estimate indoor temperature and humidity when HVAC systems are not operating. This type of analysis could be useful to compare design concepts with, for example, different amounts of thermal mass, different levels of insulation or different natural ventilation strategies. It is important to note that this is an advanced analysis and an energy modeler performing this type of modeling should be very familiar with the calculation methods used by their simulation tool.

In this phase, the owner and architect establish design requirements and goals. Additionally, research is performed to analyze the site and local code and zoning requirements. [1] This section describes several pre-design tasks, how BEM can be used to assist in the pre-design decision-making, and data gathering activities for the BEM practitioner to apply to models in later design stages. Contents', '1 Site Analysis\\n2 Energy Code and Program Analysis\\n3 Building Program\\n4 Project Goals/Targets\\n5 Additional Resources\\n6 References', '\\nSite Analysis\\nSite analysis is the study of the climatic, geographical, historical, legal, and infrastructural context of a specific site. [2] While many of these activities are performed by an architect or landscape architect, BEM practitioners can assist with the following aspects of the site analysis:', 'Climate analysis - evaluate how weather conditions affect the site and help identify effective design strategies to ensure the building will be comfortable and will achieve the desired energy performance. Site conditions - evaluate how the site\\'s location and surroundings may impact the design. Available utilities and fuel sources - determine if fossil fuel service is available at the site and if it\\'s desired for the project or whether an all-electric design will be pursued. Determine if any clean energy electricity providers or tariffs are available for the project site if desired for the project. Energy Code and Program Analysis\\nThe U.S. Department of Energy\\'s Building Technologies Program notes that \"Energy codes affect the design of all building systems separately and collectively. Designing for energy efficiency can impact the look, feel, and function of the building. For example, lighting and window design can impact cooling loads, windows can impact lighting, and so on. \"[3] It is important to understand which codes apply to the project and how they, along with any beyond-code programs, may influence the design. BEM practitioners can assist with the following tasks:', 'Determine the applicable energy code - identify the code and version in effect. Review mandatory requirements and the energy modeling procedures for the performance approach. Determine ventilation requirements - identify the ventilation code requirements and if additional ventilation is desired by the owner. Determine applicability of beyond-code programs - identify any additional energy modeling tasks or documentation are needed to comply with beyond-code programs (e.g. green building certifications, reach codes). Identify potential incentives - identify opportunities to achieve monetary incentives associated with using energy modeling in the project design process. Building Program\\nThe programming process defines how a building will be used by the occupants, including how much area will be designated for different space types. [4]  Programming is typically not an activity that involves the input of an energy modeler, but the outcome of the program must be understood by the modeler as it will inform their analysis as the project progresses. BEM practitioners should be sure to review the following aspects of the building program:', 'Review space type percentages - determine approximate percentage of area associated with different space uses in the building. Identify any special space types - determine if any space types exist in the building that may need special attention given to modeling plug loads or HVAC systems. Project Goals/Targets\\nThe American Institute of Architects (AIA) Framework for Design Excellence notes that \"[energy benchmarking and goal setting] is a critical first step for every project... benchmarks are easily shared with the design team and owner, and are a basis for a deeper conversation about how the building is intended to work. Everyone on the team should understand a project’s benchmark and its energy goals. \"[5]\\nBEM practitioners are often instrumental in helping to provide this understanding to the team. Their role includes:', \"Research performance benchmarks - review how similar building types typically perform in terms of energy use intensity (EUI), peak loads, carbon emissions, and other metrics. Set performance goals for the project - based on the benchmarking exercise, set a performance target for your project. As with the benchmarking analysis, these targets may be based on several different metrics. Determine renewable generation objectives - in addition to setting energy performance goals, projects may have goals for renewable energy production or procurement. Determine design/operation features required by owner (OPR)\\nAdditional Resources\\nSite Evaluation as a Starting Point for Green Design - Article from BuildingGreen.com describing key components of a site evaluation (beyond energy impacts).

Models of prototype buildings are available for some simulation programs, and they typically represent different building types and vintages. Example Prototype Models—High-rise Apartment, Restaurant and Secondary School\\nSimple box models\\nSimple box models are a type of whole building energy model used to inform early design. A simplified model is used to test the impact of fundamental design decisions on energy consumption and peak heating and cooling loads. The appropriate level of detail in the model depends on the state of the design. During pre-design, the model may look like a simple box. During conceptual design, the model will typically represent a simplified version of one or more design concepts. Example Simple Box Models—Pre-design (left) and Conceptual Design Massing (right)\\nShoebox models\\nShoebox models represent an isolated portion of a building, such as a single representative zone. They can be useful at any stage of design to inform specific design decisions. Example Shoebox Models—Fenestration Analysis for a Typical Space\\nDetailed models\\nDetailed models represent later stages of design. They are often used for refining or optimizing specific design strategies. Compliance models\\nCompliance models are another type of detailed model. While they may be used to analyze the design, compliance models are usually used to document the design performance for code compliance and/or above-code programs.

It is intended to complement software-specific training offered by software vendors and others. An initial focus of development will be to cater to beginner-level BEM practitioners but expand over time to include advanced material for more experienced practitioners. In addition to developing tutorials, we also plan to include background material (e.g., building physics, HVAC) to support a better understanding of how buildings really work so that modelers can better interpret and communicate the modeling results.

Additional Resources\\nBIM (Revit) to BEM Data Exchange - This IBPSA-USA webinar (video) focuses on sharing best practices for developing BIM models so that they can effectively share data with BEM software tools. Python Programming for Energy Modelers - This IBPSA-USA webinar (video) focuses on outlining the process of acquiring data science skills for building performance analysts with little or no previous programming experience. OpenStudio Measures - In OpenStudio, a \"Measure\" is a set of programmatic instructions that makes changes to an energy model to reflect its application. A large library of these measures is available, or users can create their own. Measures can be applied to a specific model, or they can be more general for use across multiple models. Modelkit - Modelkit is a free and open-source, cross-platform framework for parametric modeling developed by Big Ladder Software. Modelkit integrates two powerful concepts: templates and scripting. Templates are an old method for combining static content with dynamic inputs. Scripting is a relatively new method for automating the process of modeling. Modelkit has been applied to EnergyPlus, the California Simulation Engine (CSE), and the California compliance software tools, CBECC-Com and CBECC-Res. Eppy - Eppy is a scripting language for EnergyPlus idf files, and EnergyPlus output files. Eppy is written in the programming language Python. It allows users to programmatically navigate, search, and modify EnergyPlus idf files. A Demo of Common BIM to BEM Workflows Using gbXML - gbXML.org and IBPSA-USA sponsored this gbXML webinar. The webinar gives an overview of gbXML, a discussion about successes and struggles with BIM to BEM workflows using gbXML, and a presentation on the gbXML validator that was developed as part of an ASHRAE research project (RP-1810). BEM ToolBox - The BEM ToolBox is a suite of tools used to parse model input and output files and present the data in a format that can be analyzed more effectively. It is designed to automate repetitive tasks and  analyze model data, and the reports can be shared with other members of a project team. The tools are geared towards users of IES-VE software although support for other software tools may be added.

Codes describe requirements that must be met by projects and are enforced during the design and construction process. Standards may either represent “best practices” for design (and therefore are often followed), or, in many cases, they may be adopted by a code agency and therefore are required to be followed. In addition to specifying design characteristics that must be met, codes and standards also offer a wealth of information that can be useful for energy modelers including many numerical values that can be directly used as inputs for the models, or values that can be used to perform quality assurance on the models. This page describes several categories of codes and standards and their relevance to energy modeling. Contents', '1 Building codes\\n2 Energy codes and standards', '2.1 National Codes (Model Energy Codes)\\n2.2 State and Local Codes', '\\n3 Energy modeling codes and standards\\n4 Ventilation codes and standards\\n5 Thermal comfort codes and standards\\n6 References', '\\nBuilding codes\\nThe building code is a set of rules that specify how buildings must be constructed and the focus of the code is primarily to protect public health and safety for the construction and occupancy of the building. Buildings must comply with the code to obtain permits. [1]\\nThe scope of building codes include structural, egress, fire safety, construction materials requirements, occupancy rules, and design and construction requirements for the building systems such as mechanical, electrical, lighting, and plumbing. Energy efficiency codes and standards are also included as a building code requirement. Energy codes and standards\\nEnergy codes are a subset of the broader building code requirements. While building codes focus on ensuring safety, energy codes are designed to ensure that buildings are designed and built to meet a specified level of energy efficiency. [2]\\nEnergy codes may either be implemented following a prescriptive approach or a performance approach. The performance approach can be met by developing energy models to demonstrate that the proposed building design meets a specified energy budget, target, or other threshold. Different energy codes have different set of rules for creating the model and determining whether the modeled building passes or fails. For additional guidance on understanding modeling rules of the performance approach, refer to the page Determine the applicable energy code. National Codes (Model Energy Codes)\\nASHRAE Standard 90.1\\nIECC\\nUser’s Manuals\\nState and Local Codes\\nLocal jurisdictions will usually adopt the model codes with some amendments – variations of the above with requirements that may be slightly different, usually to respond to local climate conditions. Some states develop their energy code independently from the model national codes\\nTitle 24\\nAlso, refer to the BEMcyclopedia Links Page for additional information about Codes and Standards. Energy modeling codes and standards\\nASHRAE Standard 209 - \"Energy Simulation Aided Design for Buildings\" - Standard 209\\'s purpose is to “Define minimum requirements for providing energy design assistance using building energy simulation and analysis”[3]\\nASHRAE Standard 205 -  \"Standard Representation of Performance Simulation Data for HVAC&R and Other Facility Equipment\" defines performance maps for HVAC equipment from coils and fans to chillers and VRF systems. The Standard Project Committee works with manufacturers to develop and publish performance data sets and with BEM vendors to support the use of performance maps in BEM engines. [4]\\nASHRAE Standard 140 - “Standard Method of Test for Building Energy Simulation Computer Programs” aims to increase confidence in the use of building energy modeling (BEM) by creating standardized and citable test procedures for validating, diagnosing, and improving the current generation of BEM software. [5] \\nVentilation codes and standards\\nASHRAE Standard 62.1 specifies minimum ventilation rates and other measures intended to provide indoor air quality (IAQ) that’s acceptable to human occupants and that minimizes adverse health effects. The standard provides procedures and methods for meeting minimum ventilation and IAQ requirements to engineers, design professionals, owners, and jurisdictional authorities where model codes have been adopted. [6]  For additional guidance on ventilation codes and standards, refer to the page Determine ventilation requirements. ASHRAE Standard 62.1 - \"Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality\"\\nLocal building codes - many adopt some vintage 62.1 requirements, but this is not universally true. If 62.1, be sure you know which version, and if not, consult the local code\\nThermal comfort codes and standards\\nASHRAE Standard 55 - \"Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy\"\\nReferences', '↑ \"Building code\".

That can be a challenge for many cases, especially for early design models when many assumptions are necessary. Often, during the design process, the focus of BEM analysis is comparing alternative design options. The relative performance of different designs is less sensitive to those assumptions, assuming that assumptions are consistent between the alternative models. However, if the goal is to calculate an estimate of absolute energy consumption, then precise inputs are very important, and if the inputs align with real-world design and operation, then models can produce very accurate results.

While the level of detail is much less than the later stages of design, it is enough to generate construction cost estimates and allow the team to ensure that the design concepts fit within the project budget. [1]\\nDuring this phase, the team will typically consider many design options and the decisions they make will inform the later stages of design. This process of selecting different design options and concepts has a good amount of overlap with activities described in the conceptual design section of this site. In fact, many projects will effectively merge the conceptual and schematic phases together and refer to this combined process as \"schematic design.\" The schematic design documents developed by the team include architectural floor plans and elevation drawings, as well as engineering plans for the HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems. The architectural drawings will convey the basic layout of the building, and the engineering drawings will include system capacities and approximate locations. Detailed aspects of the design are generally not included until the design development phase. BEM practitioners can be highly impactful during this phase by helping to analyze the energy and comfort impacts of each of the design options being considered by the team. Read on for more guidance on BEM analysis that can inform the major architectural and engineering decisions made during schematic design. Contents', '1 Architectural design activities', '1.1 Progression of main design concepts\\n1.2 Develop preliminary floor plans\\n1.3 Develop preliminary facade design and elevation drawings', '\\n2 Engineering design activities', '2.1 Loads analysis\\n2.2 System selection', '2.2.1 HVAC systems selection\\n2.2.2 Lighting systems selection', '\\n2.3 Develop schematic design drawings\\n2.4 Energy (and other metrics) estimation', '\\n3 Integrated design strategies', '3.1 Thermal comfort strategy\\n3.2 Indoor air quality strategy\\n3.3 Thermal load control strategy\\n3.4 Daylighting and visual comfort strategy', '\\n4 Relevant ASHRAE Standard 209 cycles\\n5 References', \"\\nArchitectural design activities\\nDuring the schematic design phase, the architects begin to integrate the project's space needs and design goals into a set of floor plans. This is a highly iterative process where much coordination occurs between the architect and the building owner. Often, several options are presented to the building owner showing different designs and space layout, and the owner's feedback is used to refine the design. In addition to floor plan drawings, this information may also be presented in other formats such as 3D renderings or models. Many of the key design decisions are made during this stage. Decisions about the building's form and elevation/facade design can have large impacts on the building's performance and BEM analysis can be very informative in the decision making process. Progression of main design concepts\\nDuring this phase, the design concepts that were identified during the conceptual design phase will continue to be explored, vetted, and selected for inclusion in the building design. BEM analysis can support the architectural team by evaluating:\", \"Constructions and thermal mass options\\nFenestration and daylighting options\\nNatural ventilation design features\\nPassive solar design features\\nDevelop preliminary floor plans\\nA primary goal of the schematic design phase is to develop floor plan drawings that include the space type needs for the building as defined when creating the building program. The physical locations of the various space types are designed for functionality, flow, occupants' experience, and many other factors. The BEM practitioner, or mechanical engineer, will ultimately use the floor plan layout as the basis for performing load calculations and early-stage energy modeling. Because the schematic design phase considers many options, the BEM analysis can provide feedback on how each option performs relative to one another. Helpful modeling tasks may include:\", \"Analysis of energy and comfort impacts of different programming layouts\\nAnalysis of the impact of locations of special zones such as conference rooms, equipment rooms, and others\\nAnalysis of how HVAC loads differ for different programming layouts and how this may impact architectural needs such as shaft sizes, equipment room sizes, and plenum heights\\nDevelop preliminary facade design and elevation drawings\\nThe elevation drawings show the building's facade design and call out construction material types, window sizes and locations, locations of other openings such as doors and louvers, shading, and other features. The facade is an essential element that defines the building's character, provides protection from the elements, and contributes to its energy efficiency. BEM analysis can contribute to the facade design process in a number of ways:\", \"Window-to-wall ratio parametric studies to determine performance impacts of different window areas including solar gains and daylighting potential\\nShading feature design analysis\\nAnalysis of potential for natural ventilation and passive cooling with operable windows\\nAnalysis of thermal performance of different wall construction materials\\nAnalysis of thermal performance of different glazing performance specifications\\nThe BEM studies may analyze whole-building performance using a simple box model, or they may be focused studies on a specific building orientation or room type using shoebox models. Engineering design activities\\nThe engineering team collaborates closely with the architects to ensure that the building systems meet the functional needs of the building. The mechanical (HVAC) engineers consider aspects such as indoor air quality and comfort; the electrical engineers consider power and lighting needs. System selections often consider the tradeoffs between equipment cost and energy efficiency (operational costs), and also how the system choice may impact compliance with the energy code. HVAC system energy will account for a significant proportion of a building's total energy use. The amount will vary depending on the architectural design (e.g. massing and facade design), the planned usage of the building and the amount of internal gains. Energy analysis is crucial at this stage to ensure that the performance of building systems is considered in the design. Loads analysis\\nHVAC load calculation analysis is a process to determine the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning requirements for each space and system within the building. Loads analysis helps the HVAC engineers design all aspects of the system including system sizes (heating and cooling capacity), flow rates for air and water, ductwork and diffuser sizes, etc. However, during schematic design, the goal is not to design every element of the system yet. Schematic design load analysis focuses on determining overall heating and cooling capacities so that approximate sizes for boilers, chillers, and air handling systems can be identified (and included in cost estimation processes). This big-picture sizing information is also used to coordinate with the architects so that they can allocate sufficient space for equipment rooms, mechanical shafts (to route large ducts vertically between floors), and ceiling plenum cavities (to run ducts and other system features above the ceilings). Loads analysis is similar in many ways to whole-building BEM except that, where BEM analysis focuses on calculating performance over a period of time (e.g. an annual analysis), loads analysis is focused just on calculating performance at peak conditions (e.g. the hottest and coldest days of the year). Loads analysis is often performed by the HVAC engineering team, often by a member of the team who also performs BEM analysis. Often the BEM practitioner (whether they are part of the HVAC design team, or an external consultant) will be consulted at this stage to identify ways to reduce the loads in the building. Reducing the loads can result in smaller system capacities (saving first costs, reducing the size of equipment rooms, vertical shafts, and plenum height), improved thermal comfort, and significant operational energy cost savings. Load reduction modeling\\nSystem selection\\nHVAC systems selection\\nThe choice of HVAC system may be based on many factors:\", 'Efficiency - some system types are inherently more efficient than others. Projects that have set performance goals may be more likely to evaluate a range of low-energy system types. Cost - system costs may vary based on their complexity to manufacture and to install. An analysis of first costs vs. ongoing operational costs (e.g. payback analysis or life cycle cost analysis) is important to understand the true cost implications of selecting a system type. Expertise - some design firms may have more experience with a certain system type and therefore may be likely to select that system over an alternative type. Capacity - some system types have the ability to provide more cooling or heating per square foot of area than others. It is important to understand the amount of loads in each space and ensure that the system can meet the load density (load per square foot). BEM analysis that can help to inform the system selection:', 'Compare the performance of different HVAC system options\\nRead more about different HVAC system type options: HVAC system types', 'Lighting systems selection\\nDuring schematic design, the lighting system design will focus on analyzing the building space types, determining desired illuminance levels, selecting lighting fixture types, and selecting desired control options for the lights. BEM analysis that can inform the lighting system design:', 'Test strategies to reduce lighting power density and quantifying energy impacts\\nAnalyze the impact of lighting control strategies such as occupant sensor and daylight sensor controls\\nDevelop schematic design drawings\\nThe schematic design drawings and supporting documentation are at a high level, but with sufficient detail to begin estimating the construction costs. HVAC drawings include approximate sizes and locations for major equipment such as chillers, boilers, cooling towers, and air handling units. Major duct runs are typically depicted as single lines, but with the duct dimensions called out. Vertical ductwork (through shafts) are generally drawn in 2D to demonstrate they will fit within the architectural shaft spaces. The HVAC specifications and other supporting documents will indicate the basis of design and include information such as design set point temperatures, assumptions of thermal properties of the building envelope used for load calculations, description of any special features of the system including planned control strategies. BEM analysis is not typically a key component when drafting the design documents, however the load calculation process and system selection analysis that precedes the drawing phase is of utmost importance to selecting appropriate system types and ensuring the accuracy of the system sizes shown on the drawings. Energy (and other metrics) estimation\\nDuring the schematic design phase, many fundamental design decisions are made that will have significant impacts on the performance of the building. As the design progresses to later stages (design development and construction documents), it becomes increasingly difficult to change these early decisions without significant and costly redesign. Therefore, it is important that the energy and other performance metrics be estimated during schematic design to understand how the building performs relative to specific project performance goals, code compliance, or beyond-code program performance. If BEM analysis shows the project is not meeting the performance goals or complying with the code, changes can be made rather easily at this stage. A typical approach during SD is to use simple box models to capture a baseline performance (often a code-minimum baseline), and then test various design strategies against the baseline to determine how each measure, or combinations of multiple measures impacts the performance. Integrated design strategies\\nMany design decisions affect both the architectural and engineering designs, especially for high-performance buildings. It is important for the architectural and engineering teams to coordinate when developing big-picture strategies and continuing this collaboration as the strategies are developed.

However the level of detail, scope of analysis, and source of input data will vary depending on the phase of design. Early-stage analysis may use a simpler representation of the building geometry and rely more on assumptions, defaults, or \"typical\" inputs, whereas later phases aim to provide inputs that are as representative as possible of actual information on the design documents.

The geometry definition will also specify which surfaces are exposed to the exterior, surfaces that are in contact with the earth (floor slabs, basements), and any features that cast shadows on the building. The level of geometry detail will vary depending on the stage of design. Read the following tutorial for guidance on building geometry input approaches for different model types.

(Source: IBPSA-USA BEM Workshop)\\nThe source of information needed to provide inputs for a model will vary depending on the stage of design and analysis objective. Simple Box Models\\nIn most cases, limited project-specific design information is available at the time when a simple box model is created. By necessity, many model inputs will be based on typical or default values. Where project-specific information is not yet available, the goal should be to develop inputs that represent typical performance and operation. Also consider prioritizing effort on inputs that are most relevant to the design questions being evaluated. There is almost always a limited amount of time available to perform a simple box modeling exercise. If, for example, one goal of the analysis is an accurate EUI estimate, then it will be important to gather information about likely operating schedules, plug loads and any likely unusual energy end uses, because they can have a significant impact on total energy consumption. On the other hand, if the goal is to understand the relative impact of alternatives such as varying building form or window area, then generic operating schedules and internal loads may be fine. As much as possible, the model should include project-specific inputs. Typical sources of project-specific information include documentation about the building program, owner’s project requirements, and conceptual design sketches. Interviews of the owner and design team can also provide useful information on the following items. Energy performance goals\\nExpected number of occupants\\nExpected operating schedule\\nBuilding geometry constraints\\nLikely presence of end uses such as exterior lighting, commercial cooking, refrigeration, computer servers or unusual plug loads. HVAC system preferences\\nOperating data from other similar buildings, perhaps buildings occupied by the same owner\\nExamples of previous projects that are being used to inform the design of the current project (if any). Where project-specific information is not yet available, information on typical performance inputs can come from a number of sources. Modeler experience\\nDefault values from software\\nEnergy codes\\nOther references (described later below)\\nRegardless of the source of input information, getting the design team to review the list of assumptions is a valuable step to take before developing the model. Create a table listing important assumptions, such as envelope component performance, lighting power, plug loads, HVAC system type and efficiency, and operating schedules and setpoints. See the section Presenting an Input Summary for an example. Consider also highlighting uncertain assumptions, especially those that might have a big impact on the analysis, so the design team can prioritize their review. The review helps in a few ways. It can help the model to be a better representation of actual expected performance. It can also help get the team to start thinking about factors that affect performance. Detailed Models\\nAs the design progresses into the design development and construction documents phases, much more detailed information about the building's actual design will be available on the project drawings and specifications. Detailed design models will be created from information including:\", 'Plans—architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing\\nSpecifications\\nBasis of design document\\nSequence of operations\\nDiscussions with the owner and design team\\nThe architectural drawings can provide information on building geometry and space/zone configurations, wall assembly sections, elevation drawings that indicate where different wall assemblies are used and window geometry; HVAC drawings show how the systems serve the zones, call out flow rates and equipment sizes; lighting drawings show amount of lighting installed in each space/zone and indicate power of each lighting fixture. The project specifications can provide additional information on design setpoints, efficiency requirements, operational parameters, and sequences of control/operation for systems.

In the latter case, the analysis helps the architect understand the relative performance of typical massing alternatives and informs their early design decisions. Contents', '1 Impact of Massing Decisions\\n2 Massing Alternatives\\n3 Guidance on Modeling Approach\\n4 Guidance on Presenting Results', '\\nImpact of Massing Decisions\\nEarly decisions on building massing can affect building performance in many ways. Many of the impacts are associated with variations in the exposure to exterior conditions. Narrow massing options, with a high ratio of perimeter space to interior space, will perform differently from massing options with more interior space. Taller buildings will also perform differently than a shorter building of the same floor area. And the magnitude of impacts will vary with climate and building occupancy type. BEM is especially useful to assess the following impacts of massing alternatives: ', 'Heating and cooling loads and the associated energy consumption and demand. Daylighting energy savings potential. Natural ventilation feasibility and savings potential. BEM is sometimes also used to assess occupant thermal comfort, which can vary among massing alternatives due to variations in exposure to exterior surfaces and access to operable windows. And while they are not typically assessed using BEM, the following impacts may also be important to consider when comparing massing alternatives. Roof area and other surfaces available for installation of solar energy systems. Views and visual comfort for occupants. Impact on adjacent buildings due to solar shading and reflection. Embodied carbon of building materials. Massing Alternatives\\nA BEM analysis of massing alternatives will often compare options developed by the architect, but a massing study can also be very valuable even before any specific design options have been identified. In the latter case, the analysis helps the architect understand the relative performance of typical massing alternatives and informs their early design decisions. When massing alternatives have not yet been developed, consider creating models with variations in the following:', ' The fraction of floor area in perimeter zones varies significantly with building form, in this example all buildings have the same 100,000 ft2 floor area but the fraction of perimeter area varies from a low of 18% to a high of 66% depending on the aspect ratio and number of stories. Aspect ratio (the ratio of floor plan length to width)\\nNumber of stories\\nFloor-to-floor height and ceiling height\\nOrientation\\nSome factors to consider when identifying massing options for evaluation:', 'Site conditions may offer unique opportunities or constraints. Typical perimeter zone depth is 12 to 20 feet, which means that narrow floor plans with width of 50 feet or less will have a high ratio of perimeter area to interior area. (See Defining the Building Geometry for more discussion of thermal zoning)\\nFeatures such as courtyards, atriums and narrow wings can increase the fraction of floor area with exterior or daylight exposure. Buildings with larger footprints and fewer stories have larger roof area, which increases potential for daylighting via skylights and increases area available for solar energy systems. Massing options with large north and south exposures provide more opportunities for effective solar shading than options with large east and west exposures. Guidance on Modeling Approach\\nA BEM massing study typically uses a simplified approach such as that described in the Simple Box Model page. When selecting inputs for the models, refer to guidance on Preparing Model Inputs. See especially these topics:', 'Geometry. Make appropriate model simplifications, including thermal zoning: Defining the building geometry. Fenestration. Choose appropriate window area and performance: Define fenestration. Opaque constructions. Define appropriate construction types and insulation levels for the walls and roof: Define opaque envelope constructions. Internal loads. Select reasonable values for occupancy, lighting and plug loads; and include automatic daylight controls in the model so that the potential for daylighting savings is reflected in the analysis: Define internal loads and Sources for default internal gain assumptions. HVAC. Select an appropriate HVAC system and consider the implications of HVAC system choice for simple box modeling. Ventilation. Pay attention to choosing appropriate ventilation rates, especially for occupancy types with high outdoor air ventilation requirements, such as hospitals and laboratories: Ventilation\\xa0rates. As in any BEM analysis, a model quality review is important. See Review_and_analysis_to_verify_model_quality. Guidance on Presenting Results\\nFor a massing study to have a useful impact, the presentation should focus on results that are important to the project team. These results could include EUI, energy cost, peak cooling load, or other metrics. BEM results that are typically found useful are described in this page: Analyzing Model Outputs. Other important considerations: ', 'Provide answers and insights. Present results visually. Provide an input summary. Example presentation of results comparing three massing options in terms of EUI, energy cost and peak cooling load\\nFor more inspiration in developing visual presentation of massing study results, see examples on the website Project Stasio such as the following:', 'What is the impact of building massing on annual energy use?

And also, be sure you created those graphics or have permission to post them! Summary of site organization\\nThe website is organized into two main sections: Learn by Design Task, and Essential BEM Concepts. Learn by Design Task\\n Learn by Design Task - Navigating the Index\\nThe main concept of this section of the site is to organize educational resources around a typical building design project’s timeline. This is done by first identifying the major design phases of the project. Then, within each design phase, we have identified several design objectives, i.e., what the design team must accomplish during this phase. Finally, for each design objective, we identified the BEM tasks that may help to inform that specific design objective. The main page for this section includes a navigation index organized according to this concept. By expanding the sections of the index, one can drill down to more detailed pages related to each design phase, and detailed tutorials for the various BEM tasks. The main index is not user-editable (it is only editable by site administrators to ensure that the site\\'s organization principles are not changed). However, user-created tutorials can be added to this index without the help of site admins. More details on how to organize pages nicely in the index are provided in the \"best practices\" section of this help guide. \"Design Phase\" Pages\\n Design Phase Landing Page Overview\\nClicking on the title of any of the design phases in the index will bring you to a more detailed page about that particular design phase. Each design phase page begins with a short description summarizing what the design team is trying to accomplish during this phase. Then the page is divided into several sections, each of which represents a design task or design objective that is typically being worked on during the given project phase. Each of the design objective sections begins with short description of the objective. The description aims to give the reader insight into what decision the design team is trying to make. Then, a bulleted list of BEM tasks is presented. These tasks are activities that a BEM practitioner can perform to help the design team carry out the specific design objective. \"BEM Task\" Pages\\nThese are the detailed tutorials that provide guidance on how BEM practitioners can help to inform the various design tasks that occur throughout the life of a project. These pages should clearly describe what design decision may be informed by the BEM analysis, what analysis activities should be performed, and how the information might be shared with the design team in a meaningful way. More information about the type of information and organization of the BEM task tutorials is provided below in the best practices section of this help page. Essential BEM Concepts\\n Essential Concepts - Partially Expanded Index Page\\nThis section is a collection of general BEM knowledge, and fundamental skills that apply to a variety of BEM tasks. There are subsections that discuss principles of building science (how buildings work in the real world) so that modelers have a better understanding of how the models relate to these principles; there are also numerous subsections that provide guidance on how to create models at varying levels of detail depending on what stage of design the project is in; there is guidance on how to interpret simulation results (by relating the results back to the building science principles), and how to present the results effectively; and there is guidance on various time-saving approaches such as automation and scripting. Many of the \"BEM tasks\" in the \"Learn by Design Task\" section will link to additional information within the Essential BEM Concepts section of the site. The main page for this section includes a navigation index organized by the main subsections. By expanding the sections of the index, one can drill down to more detailed pages related to each subsection, and detailed tutorials for many concepts. The main index is not user-editable (it is only editable by site administrators to ensure that the site\\'s organization principles are not changed). However, user-created tutorials can be added to this index without the help of site admins. More details on how to organize pages nicely in the index are provided in the \"best practices\" section of this help guide. Glossary Pages\\nSome pages may just be simple definitions of BEM, design, building physics, or other terms commonly encountered by BEM practitioners. These pages do not need to be structured and organized like in the Learn by Design Task and Essential BEM Concepts pages. But, they are often useful to be included as links within the detailed tutorials on this site. Editing pages\\nEditing an existing page\\n Edit buttons to edit existing pages\\nEditing an existing page can easily be done by clicking either the \"edit\" or \"edit source\" buttons. If you are not logged into your account, the edit buttons do not appear. The \"edit\" button lets you edit pages using a convenient editing interface with numerous formatting tools built in (similar to a word processor). The \"edit source\" button lets you directly edit the page\\'s source code in wikitext format. Pages can either be edited all at once, or you can edit specific sections. The benefit of editing a specific section is that this approach allows for multiple editors to work on different sections of a single page without their edits conflicting. Using the editor\\n Visual Editor toolbar - overview of controls\\nThe editor (called \"Visual Editor\") is a feature of the MediaWiki software that lets users conveniently create and edit pages using a word processor style interface. An overview of the controls are provided in the thumbnail to the left. More details about how to use features of the Visual Editor are provided in the sections below. Additional help can be found on the MediaWiki Visual Editor user guide. Editing the source code (wikitext)\\nPages can also be created and edited using source code in a format called wikitext. Wikitext allows for a great deal of customization, formatting, and special controls that are not all available in the Visual Editor, however it requires a fair bit of knowledge to use effectively. Most of the information on this help page is geared around using the Visual Editor, but there are some advanced use cases where you may wish to edit the wikitext directly such as formatting tables, or inserting \"template\" information. Wikitext also includes limited support for using html tags. Additional help can be found on the MediaWiki Wikitext help page. Describing your edits\\nWhen you click the button to save your edits, you will be prompted to type a short summary of what you edited. Keep it brief (one line) but descriptive. This will help your fellow editors see what changes have been made since they last worked on the page. Adding sections to a page\\n Adding sections to a page\\nSections are a nice way of organizing the contents of a page into... sections. If sections are given meaningful titles, then readers can easily navigate the page. Another benefit of breaking up the page into sections is that the section names appear in the page\\'s table of contents. To create a new section, select the desired heading level from the text style menu (refer to the thumbnail to the right). If there is already text on the line you are editing when you change the text style, then this text will become the section title. If you are on a blank line, then any new text you write will become the section title. Note that after \"sub-heading 2\", there is very little or no visual difference in lower level sub-headings. As a general rule, try not to go \"too deep\" in section hierarchy as it tends to overcomplicate the contents. Note in the image to the right that using sections will nicely organize the page\\'s table of contents. As a final note, one of the text styles in the drop down menu is called \"page title\" although you can not actually change the title of a page while in the editor. Do not use this page title style to format other text on the page. If you really want to rename a page, see below for guidance. Adding a table of contents\\n Add a table of contents (if not added by default)\\nBy default, a table of contents (sometimes abbreviated to TOC) is automatically generated on a page when more than three section headings are used. If your page has fewer than 3 section headings, you can force the addition of a TOC. This is done by choosing \"page settings\" from the \"Options menu\" as shown in the thumbnail. It is also possible to remove the table of contents from a page although this is strongly discouraged. Some of the navigation pages have the TOC removed because navigation is designed directly into the page and the TOC is superfluous in these cases. As noted above, the TOC is automatically organized based on the titles of of headings and sub-headings. Inserting images\\n Insert an image onto the page\\nImages are strongly encouraged! Graphical representations of inputs and outputs are very important to understanding BEM concepts. When inserting images on a page, we recommend inserting them as thumbnails. They will be inserted to the right of the text section where the insertion occurred, and text will wrap around the thumbnail. From a page layout standpoint, it is preferred to use thumbnails rather than directly inserting the full size image. Clicking on a thumbnail will still allow users to expand and view the image at full size. To insert the image, select the option \"Images and media\" from the \"Insert\" menu. This will open a dialog box where you can either search for an image that has already been uploaded to BEMcyclopedia (e.g. if you like an image you see on another page and wish to reuse it elsewhere), or you can upload your own images. If you are uploading your own image, you must acknowledge that it is your own work and you have the rights to share it. You can drag an image file into the upload window, or select a file from your computer. As part of the upload process, you will be prompted to add a name to the image (usually the same as filename but if the filename is not descriptive, then give the image a meaningful name), and a description of what the image is. Finally, you will be prompted to add a caption which will appear with the image thumbnail (this caption can be changed later in the Visual Editor). Inserting tables\\nThe Visual Editor only has the ability to insert rudimentary tables. This can be done by opening the \"Insert\" menu and selecting \"Table\" but the tables are very limited in terms of formatting. If you wish to create a more visually interesting table (with highlighted cells, different colors, etc.) this can be done using the wikitext (source code) editing approach. There are some good (and free) online tools available that let you design interesting tables using a web interface and then export the table into wikitext which you can then cut and paste into your pages source code. Here is a good example website where this can be done: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/mediawiki_tables', 'Linking to other pages\\n Add links to other pages\\nA powerful feature of a wiki is linking to other pages on the site with related content. We strongly encourage using links within tutorials and other pages so that readers can dig deeper into related topics. Links to other BEMcyclopedia pages\\nAdding links is very easy. While in editing mode, select the text on your page that you wish to turn into a link, then select the \"link\" button from the toolbar. This will pop up a window which allows you to search for the page on BEMcyclopedia that you wish to link to. The search will automatically search for the text you highlighted, but it is possible (and often likely) that the BEMcyclopedia page name won\\'t match exactly. In this case, you may wish to search for it using other terms, or, if you already know the name of the page you wish to link to, then you can just enter it here. Note that the search feature is case-sensitive so be careful about using capital letters. Also, note that the highlighted text in your page (that you are turning into a link) does not necessarily need to match the full name of the linked page, as long as you connect them properly. Links to external websites\\nAdding links to external websites is very similar. Select the text you wish to turn into a hyperlink, select the \"link\" button from the toolbar, then select \"External site\" in the pop-up window and paste the URL of the site you wish to link to. Note that you must paste a complete URL here (including the http:// prefix). The best way to get the full URL is by opening the page you wish to link to and copying its full URL from your browser\\'s address bar. Adding references/citation\\n Adding the References list to bottom of page\\nGive credit where credit is due! If you have relied on other sources as you research a topic, be sure to add citations for all references. Citations should be added at the end of a sentence or paragraph that relies on external research materials. If you want to know more about how/when/why to cite a source, refer to Wikipedia\\'s article on the topic. To add the citation (while in editing mode), move your cursor to the point where you wish to add the citation, and select \"Cite\" from the toolbar. This will open a drop-down menu where you can select the type of source (e.g. website, journal, etc.). When you select the source type, a pop-up window will open that prompts you to enter information about the source such as title, authors, date of publication, etc. If you reference a source more than once on a page, the \"Cite\" menu provides an option to \"reuse\" a previously referenced source (so you don\\'t need to enter its information again). Adding the list of references to the bottom of a page\\nIf your page has citations, then you should add a list of the references to the bottom of your page. First, create a new Heading called \"References\" as the last section of your page. Then, from the \"Insert\" menu, select \"References list\" and this will insert the list onto your page. Adding categories to a page\\n Assigning categories to a page\\nThe organization of this website is largely dependent on using categories appropriately. This section describes how to add a category to a page, but please be sure to read the section below on using categories properly to keep the site organized. Don\\'t add categories to any pages without reading that first! To add a category, select the \"hamburger\" options menu and then select \"Categories.\" This will pop up a window where you can select an appropriate category to assign to the page. The search bar allows you to find an appropriate category. If you type a name of a category that does not exist, then you have the ability to create a new category with that name. But, before you add any new categories please be sure you understand the site\\'s category assignment best practices! After you have successfully assigned a category to a page and saved your edits, you will see a list of the page\\'s categories at the very bottom of the page. Creating new pages\\n New page from search\\n New page from browser\\'s address bar\\nNew pages can be created a few different ways. Link to a page that doesn\\'t yet exist - if you are creating an overview page about (for example) modes of heat transfer and wish to add a more detailed page about conduction, you can go ahead and add a link to a page titled Conduction to your overview page. When you save your edits after adding the link, it will appear in red font. This red font indicates that you have linked to a page that does not exist (whereas links to existing pages will appear in blue font). If you click the red link, you will be brought to a page and asked if you wish to create the new page titled Conduction. Type name of page in address bar - every page\\'s title appears in your browser\\'s address bar after the url (bemcyclopedia.com/wiki/index.php/TITLE). If you replace TITLE with the name of the new page you wish to create, then you will be brought to a page and asked if you wish to create the new page with this title. Type name of new page in search bar - if you search for a page title that doesn\\'t exist, the search results page will give you the option of creating the new page. Before creating the new page, just be sure that a similar page does not already exist with a different title. For additional information and guidance for creating new pages refer to the following links:', 'MediaWiki help guide on creating new pages\\nWorking with MediaWiki website guide on creating new pages\\nRenaming and redirecting pages\\n Redirecting to a different page\\'s address\\nPages are not really renamed on a wiki. If you wish to change a page\\'s title, then you will actually be \"moving\" it to a new page address. Be careful when doing this - it is possible, and quite likely, that other pages have already linked to the original page\\'s title. If you do move the page to a new address, you will be prompted whether you wish to redirect from the original title to the new title - if you do this, then page links will not break, so please do it! However, first consider whether you actually need to rename the page in the first place. If a page exists titled \"Air conditioner\", then do you really need to rename it as \"air conditioning unit\"? Probably not! In many cases, it is preferable to redirect an alternate title to the pre-existing page title rather than moving the existing page to a new title. Deleting pages\\nDeleting pages is disabled for all users except for administrators. Deleting is generally to be avoided as it will likely break links from other pages. Administrators reserve the right to delete any pages that are spam, or delete specific sections of spam content. If you feel that a page needs to be deleted, please contact the website\\'s administrators. (this link will open a page to send an email. Search for user name BEMAdmin and fill in the email form). Be sure to include a link for the page you wish to be deleted along with an explanation. Editing the site navigation\\nAs noted above in the section summary of site organization, much consideration has been put into organizing the site\\'s contents into the two main groups to allow for intuitive navigation. The main homepage of the site and the overview pages for Learn by Design Task and Essential BEM Concepts have been protected (restricted to read-only) to ensure that the site navigation remains unaltered. However, there is still the ability to add newly created pages to the indexes (described below) so that they appear nicely organized in the overview pages. If you wish to propose changes to the protected navigation pages, see below for guidance. Proposing changes to the site navigation\\nThis website is intended to be under constant maintenance and development. We expect that, over time, it may make sense to add new sections or make other types of modifications to the navigation. As noted above, this functionality is currently restricted to site administrators only. However, if you wish to propose a new section, just send an email to the user BEMAdmin using this link. Be very specific about the proposed changes. Please note that there is nothing restricting you from going ahead and creating new pages for your desired topic area. Feel free to create the content and organize it as you please (e.g., using a navigation page with links to your new content). We will work with you to integrate it into the main site navigation after you have contacted us with your request. Using categories properly to keep site organized\\n Category Tree - Learn by design task. Shows the hierarchical structure, and note that pages are assigned to the lowest level of subcategory. As noted above in the section summary of site organization, the main overview pages for Learn by Design Task and Essential BEM Concepts each have a detailed index of pages, organized according to design phase (in the case of Learn by Design Task) or main subject area (for Essential BEM Concepts). These indexes are automatically generated by assigning appropriate categories to each page. Choosing the right category\\nTheoretically, you could assign any and all categories to a page, but then that page would appear in every section of the index and the index wouldn\\'t be very useful for navigation. There may be some cases where it makes sense for a page to appear in a couple sections, but please try to limit the number of categories assigned to the page. If you want the page to appear in both the Learn by Design Task and Essential BEM Concepts sections, this is also possible but make sure it really makes sense to do this. In essence, the categories exist in a hierarchical tree structure that aligns with the website\\'s index pages. Familiarize yourself with these category trees as described below. Learn by Design Task categories\\n Category Tree - expanded view of the Essential concepts tree. Expanding the tree view will show a list of all pages assigned to a subcategory. The category tree for Learn by Design Task pages can be found here. The structure of the tree is identical to the index on the Learn by Design Task page. It is organized first by major design phases of the project. Then, within each design phase, subcategories exist for design objectives. These design objectives categories are the ones you should be applying to your tutorials (aka BEM tasks tutorials). You\\'ll note that by expanding the tree (by clicking the little arrow) will show a list of all the pages assigned to that design objectives subcategory. You\\'ll also note that the design phase categories are NOT assigned to the tutorial pages. Take a moment to browse the category tree before deciding how to categorize your page. Essential BEM Concepts categories\\nSimilarly, the structure of the Essential BEM Concepts category tree is identical to the index on the Essential BEM Concepts page. It is organized according to this section of the website\\'s main topic areas. As noted above, assign the lowest level subcategories to your pages to maintain the functionality of the website\\'s index. The example in the adjacent thumbnail shows several tutorial pages assigned appropriately to the \"Envelope Inputs\" subcategory (not to the parent \"Input Tutorial\" category). Experimental categories\\n Experimental Category Tree - ASHRAE 209 Cycles\\nThere are a few experimental sets of categories being considered for future addition to the website. We have developed a category tree for designating tutorials according to ASHRAE Standard 209. In the future, we may introduce a new navigation view that lets users navigate based on the ASHRAE 209 cycles. These categories have not been widely applied to the tutorials, but please feel welcome to do so! Another category under consideration is user type (i.e., are the pages targeted towards architects, engineering practitioners, researchers, etc.). If you think this would be a valuable addition, please let us know by sending an email to the user BEMAdmin using this link. Best practices - Learn by Design Task\\nThese tutorials are primarily focused on teaching users how to apply a model for use on a specific design task. The tutorial should not teach you how to build a model, but rather how to take a model and use it to test different design options. The nuts and bolts of how to build a model is covered in the \"Essential BEM concepts\" section of the website and can be referenced by many other task-specific pages. Here is a practical example of how the content is intended to be separated between the two sections of the website. In the Conceptual Design phase, many design analysis tasks are likely to start with an early-stage, simple box model and then test different design alternatives on that model. One study may analyze different window-to-wall ratios, another may analyze the building\\'s orientation. For the example of the building orientation analysis, the tutorial page starts by telling the user to \"create a simple box model\" and simply providing a link to the simple box model tutorial (under the Essential BEM concepts section of the site). Now, within the orientation analysis page the tutorial can focus on how to use that simple box model by modeling it with different rotations, shading features, etc. The tutorial should really focus on giving the user advice (\"try these options,\" \"test these parameters over this range,\" \"consider combining this feature with another EEM,\" and so forth). The simple box model tutorial can be used over and over again across many of the conceptual design tutorials, but the specific manner in which the simple box model is used and advice to the modeler is likely to vary and can be tailored for each design task analysis. As a general rule, if you find yourself needing to explain how to model something, it should go in the \"Model Inputs\" section. Similarly, if you find yourself needing to explain a building science concept, it should go in that section. The benefit of splitting that content from the \"Learn by Design Task\" tutorials is that it can be generalized and reused across many different tutorials by linking. Then the Learn by Design Task section can really focus on applying the knowledge to a specific design task. Best practices - Essential BEM concepts\\nThese tutorials are focused on teaching users basic concepts about buildings, building science, and BEM software concepts. They are not intended to teach users how to analyze specific design concepts within the building design process, but rather to give users the necessary knowledge prior to analyzing project-specific design concepts. It is intended that these best practices will be useful to a large number of \"Learn by Design Task\" tutorials and therefore will be included as links within the design task tutorials. As an example, if a \"design task\" analysis is being performed to analyze window to wall ratio, then links to \"Essential BEM concepts\" tutorials relating to how to create window geometry, how to perform parametric analysis, and building science tutorials related to window conduction and solar heat gains would be very useful to include to help users understand how to perform the design task, and how to analyze the results. These \"essential concepts\" might also be useful to include for other design tasks such as shading analysis, building orientation analysis, and many others. As a general rule, try to make the \"Essential BEM concepts\" tutorials as generic as possible - they should not be focused on a specific design analysis, but rather general enough to be useful in understanding many different design task analyses. In other words, keep these Essential concepts broad - if there is something that is very specific to a certain design task, then that content can go in the \"Learn by Design Task\" section.

      "The BEMcyclopedia was created as a free resource for energy modelers to learn about building energy modeling (BEM), and to share their knowledge with others. It provides practical guidance to practitioners on how, when, and why to apply BEM at various steps in the design process and how to use the analysis to inform design decisions. The site's content is intended to apply to any energy modeling software that the user might choose. It focuses on beginner-level BEM practitioners, but also has plans to cater to more experienced practitioners with advanced material. The scope of the site is focused on building performance analysis with a focus on energy and emissions. \n",

It is not uniformly peer-reviewed, but readers can correct errors and engage in casual peer review.
