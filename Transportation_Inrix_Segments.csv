Data Set|Column|Full Name|Data Type|Description
Inrix_Segments|ID|Inrix Segment id|string|A unique string identifier for road segments, denoting either the Traffic Message Channel (TMC) code or the INRIX XD Segment ID. It serves as a key reference point for data integration and differentiation.
Inrix_Segments|Type|Inrix Segment type|string|A value indicating segment type, with "TMC" or "XDS" values. "XDS" signifies the use of INRIX XD technology, distinguishing between traditional TMC and advanced INRIX XD segments. TMC signified length from traffic message channel data.
Inrix_Segments|ReferenceSpeed|The free flow speed on the segment|integer|A value representing free flow speed on the segment, crucial for understanding expected velocity under minimal or no congestion conditions.
Inrix_Segments|Length|Length of segment in meters|float|A value indicating the segment's length in meters, essential for infrastructure planning, congestion analysis, and transportation modeling.
Inrix_Segments|FRCLevel|Functional Road Classification|integer|Functional Road Classification (FRC) in the Inrix_Segments dataset is represented by numerical codes that categorize roads based on their significance and purpose. In Inrix, FRC values range from 1 to 3, with 1 indicating highways and major intersections, 2 representing major arteries, and 3 signifying major roads. FRC values 4 and higher are assigned to neighborhood streets. This classification system provides valuable insights into the road network hierarchy, aiding in transportation planning, route optimization, and overall analysis of the road segment's characteristics and intended use.
Inrix_Segments|Name|Name of the road|string|The value represents  the name or designation of the road where the segment is located. The road name serves as a descriptive identifier for the segment.
Inrix_Segments|Country|Country|string|The value represents the country where the road segment is located, providing geographical context for regional analysis.
Inrix_Segments|Latitude|Latitude|float|A value that represents the geographic latitude coordinate of the road segment.  This information is essential for accurately mapping and visualizing the segment's location on a geographic coordinate system. It enables spatial analysis, such as proximity calculations, route planning, and integration with other location-based datasets. 
Inrix_Segments|Longitude|Longitude|float|A value that represents the geographic longitude coordinate of the road segment. Longitude is a crucial component of geospatial data, specifying the east-west position of the segment relative to the prime meridian. This information is vital for accurately mapping and visualizing the segment's location on a geographic coordinate system. It enables spatial analysis, such as proximity calculations, route planning, and integration with other location-based datasets.
