**AI-Enhanced Data Infrastructure Energy Project**

Welcome to the  AI-Enhanced Data Infrastructure Energy Project! The project seeks to address pivotal decarbonization challenges within building and transportation sectors by creating advanced, semantically-enriched data infrastructures. We aim to overcome prevalent barriers such as data diversity and requisite expertise, hindering stakeholders from leveraging data for decarbonization objectives. The initiative involves the development of a specialized infrastructure, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, renowned for semantic data analysis, textual data mining, and human-machine interaction. This will empower systematic, interactive data usage, filling existing expertise gaps. Key milestones include real-time data preparation, developing LLMs-as-agent frameworks, initiating an interactive user interface, and conducting an interdisciplinary case study for Tucson. The project promises societal and educational impacts, aligning with UA Sustainability & Climate Action Plan and DOE’s Clean Energy Standard, while incorporating AI and data science into UA’s architectural and civil engineering curriculum.

In this Github Repository, We have categorized the data into two types:
A. Building Energy Data
B. Transportaion Data

**A. Building Energy Data**

This building energy data has a collection of 21 datasets related to building energy usage. These datasets are provided in CSV file so that it can be used future in python and LLM semantic search. For easier reference for normal users, we have also included excel and word formats in the repository.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the Draft Building Energy Data, follow these steps:

1. **Accept the Box Drive Collaboration Request**: Make sure you've accepted the collaboration request sent to your email to access the shared folder.
2. **Data Access :**
The datasets are stored both locally and online. To facilitate easy access for all project members, we've shared the data in a dedicated directory folder on Box under the path: (https://arizona.app.box.com/folder/244432138957). Each dataset's exact location, whether on local storage or through a URL or API, is specified in the final column of the provided list.

2.1 **Local Storage**

Datasets stored locally can be accessed by project members who have direct access to the storage medium. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to access these files.

2.2 **URL Access**

Datasets accessible through URLs can be downloaded directly from their respective links. These links are provided within the dataset list for ease of access.

3. **Download the Data**: Download the datasets you need, available in CSV, Excel and Word formats as per the requirement.


4.  **Explore and Analyze**: Start your data exploration and analysis to uncover insights into building energy usage.

5. **Future works**



**B. Transportation Energy Data**
This transportation data has a collection of 2 different transportation data sources, Inrix and Miovison. The datasets are provided through APIs developed by the Center for Applied Transportation Sciences (CATS) in JSON format, which is a widely used method of data transfer in the industry. In addition, we provide CSV files for all the data schema of the datasets. All the resources can be used further in Python and LLM semantic search. For easier reference for normal users, we have also included Excel formats in the repository.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the Draft Transportation Data, follow these steps:

1. **Accept the Box Drive Collaboration Request**: Make sure you've accepted the collaboration request sent to your email to access the shared folder.
2. **Data Access :**
The instructions and the schema of the datasets are stored both locally and online. To facilitate easy access for all project members, we've shared the data in a dedicated directory folder on Box under the path: (https://arizona.box.com/s/g6f1pqblwde2ewyjxtty7h2kdwugd0p0).

2.1 **Local Storage**
Datasets stored locally can be accessed by project members who have direct access to the storage medium. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to access these files.

2.2 **API Access**
Each dataset's API is well described in the document (https://arizona.box.com/s/11dy82qd5vki837oqkg1hbdb6cvpml3f).

3.  **Explore and Analyze**: Start your data exploration and analysis to uncover insights into the transportation situation to efficient the transportation flow and further reduce energy consumption.
4. **Future works**




Contribution : We encourage contributions from all project members. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or new data to add, please feel free to edit and reply if there are some mistakes. Feel free to change Github Repository or Project Name if any better ideas.
Thank you.






**Future works**

Pycosim, LLM interactive data analysis and many more contents will be added after the next meeting  in the repository.





**Installation for RAG workflow**
