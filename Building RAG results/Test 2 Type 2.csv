TRUE,Which database should I refer to if I want to know about macrospic energy data related to commerical building in Arizona?,"Based on the provided information, here is an answer to your question: 

To obtain macroscopic energy data related to commercial buildings in Arizona, the most relevant database to consult is the Energy Information Administration - Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). CBECS is a program by the U.S. Energy Information Administration that provides statistical information on energy usage and characteristics for commercial buildings in the United States. 

The data is collected through surveys completed by building owners and managers, as well as energy suppliers. It covers building characteristics, energy consumption by different end uses, and energy expenditures. The surveys are conducted periodically, with the most recent data available for 2018 representing 5.9 million commercial buildings in the U.S. 

CBECS provides data at the national level and by census division. Arizona falls under the Mountain census division, so you can filter the data accordingly to obtain energy information specific to commercial buildings in Arizona. 

The CBECS data can be accessed through the EIA website, and it can be used to build and calibrate sampled energy models for commercial buildings in the region. The database is available at the provided URL: https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
