Data Set|Column|Full Name|Data Type|Description
Miovision_Intersection|IntId|Intersection id|string|A value that serves as the unique identifier for the intersection within the dataset. It plays a crucial role in distinguishing and referencing specific intersections.
Miovision_Intersection|IntName|Intersection Name|string|The value represents  the name or designation of the intersection where the sensor/device is located. The instersection name serves as a descriptive identifier for the segment.
Miovision_Intersection|Longitude|Longitude|number|A value that represents the geographic longitude coordinate of the intersection. Longitude is a crucial component of geospatial data, specifying the east-west position of the intersection relative to the prime meridian. This information is vital for accurately mapping and visualizing the segment's location on a geographic coordinate system. It enables spatial analysis, such as proximity calculations, route planning, and integration with other location-based datasets.
Miovision_Intersection|Latitude|Latitude|number|A value that represents the geographic latitude coordinate of the intersection.  This information is essential for accurately mapping and visualizing the intersection's location on a geographic coordinate system. It enables spatial analysis, such as proximity calculations, route planning, and integration with other location-based datasets. 
Miovision_Intersection|CustomId|Custom id|string|A value that captures a custom identifier assigned to the intersection. The custom ID allows for additional user-defined c.ategorization or classification of intersections based on specific criteria or preferences
